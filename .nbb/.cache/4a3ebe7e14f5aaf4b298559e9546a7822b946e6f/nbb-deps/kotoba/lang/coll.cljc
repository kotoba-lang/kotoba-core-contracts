;; exhausting the stack. Silently widening bounded-prewalk/bounded-postwalk
;; to be unbounded would change that safety property out from under every
;; caller that added the bound on purpose, without them touching a line of
;; their own code.
;;
;; walk/prewalk/postwalk/prewalk-replace/postwalk-replace below are a
;; SEPARATE, NEW set of functions that exist for callers who need genuine
;; clojure.walk-equivalent unbounded semantics (e.g. transforming a
;; document/AST of unknown, unbounded depth where no artificial ceiling is
;; correct). They are not a replacement for bounded-*, and bounded-* is not
;; a restricted version of them to be "corrected" back to matching. Both
;; pairs are permanent, parallel API surface:
;;
;;   bounded-prewalk / bounded-postwalk  -- depth-capped, throws past the cap
;;   walk / prewalk / postwalk           -- uncapped, matches real clojure.walk
;;
;; If you are reading this because you noticed the two pairs disagree and
;; are tempted to make bounded-* match walk/prewalk/postwalk (or vice
;; versa): don't. That disagreement is the entire point of this section
;; existing. Add a new function, or take the bound as an explicit argument
;; at the call site (bounded-prewalk/-postwalk already accept a max-depth
;; override) -- do not change what either name means.
;;
;; Semantics (walk's cond order, the map-entry/record special cases, prewalk
;; = top-down, postwalk = bottom-up) are transcribed from clojure.walk, not
;; reinvented. One documented representational difference: a walked
;; map-entry is reconstructed here as a plain 2-element vector rather than
;; the host's native map-entry object (clojure.lang.MapEntry on :clj, a
;; MapEntry record on :cljs). This is NOT a behavior divergence for any
;; normal use -- `(= (first {:a 1}) [:a 1])` is true in both Clojure and
;; ClojureScript (a map entry is `Sequential` and compares by value against
;; a vector of the same two elements), and a plain 2-element vector conj's
;; onto a map exactly like a real map-entry does. It is only observable via
;; a type-check like `(instance? clojure.lang.MapEntry ...)`, which this
;; library does not attempt to reproduce.

;; -- Key coercion (clojure.walk's keywordize-keys / stringify-keys) ----------
;;
;; These are the two clojure.walk entry points that are NOT walk generics:
;; they are specific map-key coercions built on postwalk. They are here rather
;; than in a caller because every JSON/YAML/query-string boundary in this
;; workspace re-rolls them, and each hand-rolled copy tends to differ on the
;; two cases below.
;;
;; Two behaviours transcribed from clojure.walk that are easy to get wrong and
;; that the tests pin:
;;
;;   1. Only STRING keys are keywordized, and only KEYWORD keys are
;;      stringified. Every other key type (number, vector, symbol, nil) passes
;;      through untouched. A hand-rolled `(map-keys keyword m)` does not do
;;      this -- it would coerce a number key too.
;;
;;   2. `stringify-keys` uses `name`, so it DROPS a keyword's namespace:
;;      `:a/b` becomes `"b"`, not `"a/b"`. That is lossy and it is not
;;      round-trippable through `keywordize-keys` (`"b"` comes back as `:b`).
;;      This is clojure.walk's actual behaviour, so it is what a call site
;;      being migrated off clojure.walk depends on; do not "fix" it here.
;;      A caller who needs the namespace preserved wants
;;      `(map-keys #(if (keyword? %) (subs (str %) 1) %) m)`, not this.
;;
;; Both rebuild each map with `(into {} ...)`, like clojure.walk: a sorted-map
;; or a record in the input comes back as a plain map. Unbounded, matching the
;; walk/prewalk/postwalk pair above rather than the bounded-* pair.
