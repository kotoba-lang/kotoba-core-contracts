  The pair is the point. Signature verification used to be `:clj`-only and
  rejected everything under `:cljs`, and the JVM suite passing said nothing
  about that -- it could not, because it never loaded the other branch. Two
  runtimes over one committed corpus is what makes the claim 'this verifies
  signatures' checkable rather than host-local."
